# HiraganaQuizApp

A quiz app which helps teach the user to recognise the symbols in the Hiragana language and how to pronounce them. Currently the user must go through the entire app from beginning to end.

Future ideas: Make the UI more asthetically pleasing, making sure it adheres to Google's material designs. Add more quiz sections and enable the user to stop at the end of one section and be able to return to the app at the beginning of the next section without having to start over.
